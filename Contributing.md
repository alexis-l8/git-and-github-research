### What are issues?
    Issues are a way for everyone to keep track of tasks and improvements.
    They are visible to the rest of your team.

### What does a GitHub issue look like?
    A title and description
    Colour-coded labels help you categorize & filter

### What is a milestone?
    A milestone acts like a container for issues.
    Milestones enable you to create a filing system for issues.
    This can be used for associating issues with a specific feature or project phase.
    E.g. a Weekly Sprint for all the issues you want to solve within a specific time frame.

### What is an assignee?
    An assignee is the person responsible for working on the issue at any given time.
    Assignees are selected the same way milestones are, through the grey bar at the top of the issue.

### Labels
    Labels are a way to organise issues.
    Issues can have as many labels as you want.
    You can use labels to filter and search for issues.

### @mentions
    You can use @mentions to notify other GitHub users and teams.
    Further research: Mastering Markdown Guide on GitHub.

    In addition to @mentions, you can /cc in people

### Comments
    Allow anyone with access to the repository to provide feedback.

### Search
    The search box at the top of the page lets you search through issues.
    You can scope search results by:
    keyword
    state (e.g. closed)
    assignee

### Finding issues in other repos
    Use repo URL followed by "issues/#1"

### Keywords to use in pull requests --
    close
    Closes
    resolves
    resolve
    fixes
    fixed
    -- The above will automatically close an issue
    referenced with a #<issue-name>

### The Issue Dashboard
    Go to github.com/issues
    Works similarly to issues section, but collects issues differently:
    All issues in repositories you own and collaborate on
    Issues assigned to you
    Issues you've created
    Basically, it shows you your overall to-do list

### Pulse
    A snapshot of everything that's happened in the repo over a period of time
    It's found underneath a repo
    Pulse is a good way to catch up with repos when you've been away
