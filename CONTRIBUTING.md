## Assuming you have access to the repo
1. Clone the repo with `git clone <repo-url>`
2. Create a new branch with a name describing the new feature with `git checkout -b <new-branch-name>`
3. Make and commit your changes on the new branch with `git commit -am '<Commit message>'`
4. Push your changes to Github with `git push origin <new-branch-name>`
5. Visit the repo on github.com, switch to <new-branch-name> and create a pull request
6. Describe your changes in the pull request, and potentially assign someone to review
